# BayesianProject

Project as part of the Bayesian Statistics course at ENSAE. We propose a review of the following paper:


Kaufmann, S. (2010). Dating and forecasting turning points by Bayesian clustering with dynamic structure: a suggestion with an application to Austrian data, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 25, 309 â€“ 344.


In order to replicate the results, you can find all the programs in ``src_matlab``, that contains the code of the paper (Which has been adapted and corrected because the version of the code available online is deprecated). Once you cloned the repo run the following commands:

```matlab
run 'start_model4_logit'
run 'permut_MS_ALL'
run 'plot_ALL'
```

Please, make sure you have the matlab's library *statistics and machine learning toolbox*.

For the implementation of *ASTRIDE*, run the notebook ``ntbk_astride.ipynb``
